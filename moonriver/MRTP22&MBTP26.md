[Proposal: MB26/MR22] Dwellir Q2 2024 RPC Services

Abstract - The Moonbeam has been benefiting from Dwellir’s public service for more than a year. In the most recent 3 months we served more 2.3 billion requests. The usage is growing steadily and hopefully there is no slowing down.

Motivation - The Dwellir mission is to serve developers worldwide with instant data access and a comprehensive suite of tools so that they can build web3 applications. We’ve proved our intent with the Moonbeam community by continually running this for free.

Project Overview and Team Experience - We currently run RPC services for Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha and more than 100 other parachains other blockchain networks . Currently, we are processing 1 billion requests per day on average and you will see throughout this proposal that our experience within the Moonbeam ecosystem is extensive.

One of the key differentiators with Dwellir is that we own and operate our own bare metal machines which have several important effects.

Performance: Bare metal servers offer superior performance and low-latency communication, essential for decentralized networks to efficiently process transactions and reach consensus.

Security: Bare metal servers provide enhanced security and isolation, safeguarding sensitive data and assets in a decentralized network.

Control: With bare metal servers, node operators have full control over hardware and software configurations, ensuring adherence to network rules and consensus mechanisms.

Reliability: Bare metal servers offer robustness and stability, making them reliable choices for continuous operation in decentralized network.

Expertise: Our team has a proven track record of creating tailor-made blockchain infrastructure that align with the Moonbeam community’s specific needs.

Support: We don’t just build and leave – our team stands by the community for the long haul. We engage with ongoing support, maintenance, and optimization services to keep the networks running smoothly and efficiently.

Rationale - A service like Dwellir’s ensures that developers can build without the overheads and costs of managing enterprise infrastructure. Furthermore, users of wallets and dapps can have a smooth experience with RPCs that deliver fast data reliably.

Overall Cost - Based on our current cost measurements across Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha nodes.

Total monthly cost = $1,542.52 per month
Total Q2 cost = $4627.57
This includes multiple sites in Sweden and extended access in Tunisia. We’re also opening datacenters in Singapore and US and we would be default host services there at no extra cost under this current proposal.

Splitting by 60% GLMR and 40% MOVR

GLMR : 5228.9
MOVR: 81
Use of Treasury Funds - To cover the costs of hardware operation and maintenance. We own and operate our own bare metal services in 4 locations.

Specifications - Dwellir will provide archival publicly available RPC nodes.

HTTPS and Websockets APIs for Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase alpha
24/7 monitoring and upgrade notifications
Public API’s are subject to a rate limit of 30 API Calls/second
