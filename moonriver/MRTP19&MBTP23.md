**Abstract**

This proposal aims to ensure the continued availability of the Moonbeam Multisig interface (aka Moonbeam Safe), as well as the provision of support services for incidents, errors, discrepancies, and situations that require quick palliative actions, exemplifying the migration to WalletConnect v2 update or when the ledger, in a widespread web3 context, showing compromised behavior (meaning, we proactively disable it, conduct extensive testing, and reactivate it once everything is secure). Additionally, it involves generating reports, adding new functionalities such as Safe Apps, Modules, and Wallets and keeping the Safe components up to date.

All future tokens received by this grant will be exclusively used to cover infrastructure costs and to support our team (for maintenance, investment in new initiatives within the Moonbeam ecosystem, and as bonuses for our developers actively engaged in the project).

**Motivation**

Moonbeam Multisig is a fork of Gnosis Safe, which is well known as the most trusted platform to store digital assets on EVM due to its programmability. We consider this project a successful case where community users, DAOs and DeFi projects trust and use it to safely store assets and interact with Smart Contracts which directly supports TVL growth and would keep benefiting the Moonbeam community.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**

As the upstream Safe codebase is being constantly updated and changed by the Safe team, new releases need to be merged making sure it is updated and compatible with the Moonbeam Multisig instance.

Regular Safe updates will be performed and released on Moonbeam networks (Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase). Updates consider Frontend (mainly user experience improvements), Backend services and Smart Contract.

Optimization also includes research and implementation of such features as Safe dApps, Modules, Guards, External Wallets Connectors, and customizations according to community needs.

Our team is a combination of management and development skills:

-   fCTO: Ivan.
-   Project Manager: Eduardo.
-   Blockchain Engineers: Nick, Marta, and Nikita.
-   DevOps Engineers: Leonid, and Ilya.
-   Tester: Anton.

Protofire DAO team:

-   Worked as part of the Gnosis team on delivery of web and desktop versions of Gnosis Safe.
-   Delivered Gnosis Safe Apps (such as Compound, Synthetix Mintr Safe App, designed ENS Manager).
-   Created a devkit to improve the synchronization of the code in the Gnosis DApps.
-   Is a Gnosis Chain and Gnosis Beacon Chain validator.
-   Have been deploying and maintaining Gnosis Safe instances over 30 chains such as: Evmos, Astar, Scroll, Mantle, Linea, Cronos, Holesky, Neon EVM, Rootstock to name a few.
-   Is an active member of the Safe community ([Safe Guardians](https://forum.safe.global/t/guardians-gather/265)); we use our power to contribute positively to the ecosystem, aligning with Safe vision to drive the adoption of smart contract wallets.

**Rationale**

Moonbeam Multisig adds value to the ecosystem in the following ways:

-   Gives the community a trusted custody option for asset management. Safe smart contracts have passed the highest possible security standards in the industry including Formal Verification.  [Check it out](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/tree/78494bcdbc61b3db52308a25f0556c42cf656ab1/docs).
    
-   Allows Protocols to deploy and interact with smart contracts in a secure manner which attracts top protocols, increases adoption and TVL.
    
-   Moonbeam Multisig attracts high-net-worth individuals, companies, holders, funds, developers, DAOs, and investors due to its reputation and programmability.
    

**Key Terms  _(optional)_**

Safe/Gnosis Safe/Multisig Wallet: multi-signature smart contract wallet that allows users to define a list of owner/signer accounts and a threshold number of signers required to confirm a transaction.

**Overall Cost**

We are requesting funding for 7 months, starting from December/23, which was not part of the previous grant, and covering the first semester of 2024, from January (1) to June (6).

We had the opportunity to gradually reduce infrastructure costs (~22% less), so for this grant, we’ll be requesting a smaller amount compared to the previous grant, adding only a 10% margin for any potential fluctuations.

Total cost: 51,359 USD (equals a monthly cost of $6,4k + infrastructure costs) equivalent to 60/40 respectively in GLMR and MOVR.

The conversion rate will be set as the 30-day twap (time-weighted average price).
