## [OnFinality High Performance Public Infrastructure Transition Project](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb19-mr14-onfinality-high-performance-public-infrastructure-transition-project/1303)

**Abstract**  -  
As Moonbeam Foundation looks to reduce its funding of RPC providers confirmed  [here](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/q2-q3-rpc-service-provider-treasury-proposals/1114/37), OnFinality will be reducing service levels for Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha. This proposal outlines costs to allow for a smooth transition for end users that may be hard coded to OnFinality RPC endpoints and need to make changes.

**Motivation**  -  
OnFinality is the longest serving RPC provider which currently servicing a large proportion of requests for all Mooonbeam networks. This funding will allow a smooth transition period for the projects in the Moonbeam community that rely on OnFinality’s services.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**  -  
[OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/) is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. Our mission is to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.

**Rationale**  -  
OnFinality is serving the largest portion of requests in the Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha ecosystem therefore it is clear that many projects rely on our services to operate smoothly.  **Both Moonbeam and OnFinality wish to prevent disruption to our users, so the reduction of services will take a phased approach to enable a smooth transition.**

**Overall Cost**  -  
The total combined costs is $9,000 - this covers a large discounted API service and the running of 3 bootnodes until the end of the period before we discontinue these.

**Use of Treasury Funds**  -  
The transition will take place over 1 month in the period of October 2023. We are requesting a discounted fixed price of our API service as we introduce a reduction of service throughout the transition period.

Th funding amount is all inclusive of capital and operating expenses, administration time from OnFinality DevOps, onboarding costs, backup costs, and all other monitoring and right-sizing by our team.

**Steps to Implement**  -

# OnFinality’s Transition Plan

### 1 October to 1 November 2023

-   OnFinality will continue to run the 3 bootnodes until 1 November 2023
-   We will begin to introduce reduced rate limits in a staggered manner: first reducing from 50/s with 100/s bursts to a flat 50/s for the month of October.
-   This will provide one month of public RPC service at similar to previous levels while reliant projects make the below adjustments
-   During this time, teams can transition to other public endpoints or sign up for an  [OnFinality Private Endpoint](https://app.onfinality.io/)

### After 1 November 2023

OnFinality remains dedicated to the Moonbeam ecosystem and all the amazing teams we have worked with to date.

OnFinality’s private Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha endpoints will continue unchanged for all users on paid plans.

OnFinality will further reduce the rate limits of our free Moonbeam, Moonriver, and Moonbase Alpha endpoints from 1 November 2023 so that we can continue to provide the service in a sustainable manner. After this point, the public endpoint should only be used for development and testing purposes.
