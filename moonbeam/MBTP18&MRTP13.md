## [OnFinality High Performance Public Infrastructure (2023, Q3)](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-mb18-mr13-onfinality-high-performance-public-infrastructure-2023-q3/1302)
**Abstract**  - Further to the Moonbeam RPC Provider discussion post  [here](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/q2-q3-rpc-service-provider-treasury-proposals/1114/37), we are requesting funding for retroactive costs of the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure in Q3 (July, August, September) of 2023 for Moonbeam, Moonriver and Moonbase Alpha.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**  -  [OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/) is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. Our mission is to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.

**Rationale**  - Setting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult, time consuming, and expensive:

-   It requires a level of server development expertise that many do not have
-   It’s costly to run a full node nearly continuously, especially when your dApp’s traffic is low and inconsistent.
-   Running production level infrastructure is especially tricky. You need to autoscale quickly to handle bursty traffic, and you want to provide services in different regions around the world to provide low latency services - all of this is incredibly costly, but comes with significant economies of scale for a provider.
-   DevOps requires constant attention - time that would be better spent elsewhere building.

A shared node API service helps mitigate these barriers of entry to trying accessing a new protocol by reducing all these costs to near zero. We manage all the nodes for our users and distribute them across the world (with intelligent routing) to achieve global scalability from day 1, we monitor each node and ensure that they meet certain service levels, and we have the expertise and scale to handle production workloads and high peak traffic.

In summary, we try to reduce the pain of getting started on the Moonbeam Networks and minimise the costs of accessing secure nodes while traffic from your dApp is low. When you grow, you can continue to use our shared API service, or we also  [provide access to one click deploy dedicated Moonbeam / Moonriver/ Moonbase Alpha nodes](https://onfinality.io/networks)  to any cloud of your choosing.

**Overall Cost**  - We’ve created two proposals to cover the combined running costs for our infrastructure - one for Moonriver network and one for both Moonbeam and Moonbase Alpha Networks. In accordance with the guidance from Moonbeam foundation, we will request 80% from the Moonbeam treasury (in GLMR) and 20% from the Moonriver treasury (in MOVR). The total outstanding costs for these networks are USD$6,783.00 for Moonriver and USD$27,132.00 for Moonbeam.

**Use of Treasury Funds**  - All funds will be used to pay for resources and infrastructure used to provide the service during July, August, September (Q3) of 2023.

**Specifications**  - details of our service can be found in the full proposals linked at the bottom of this post.

**Steps to Implement**  - This service has already been provided and we are proud to have achieved 99.99%, 99.98% and 99.98% uptime for Moonriver, Moonbeam and Moonbase Alpha respectively ([https://status.onfinality.io/](https://status.onfinality.io/) ).
